# 🔐 TryHackMe Challenges

Welcome to my **TryHackMe Challenges** repository — a collection of hands-on cybersecurity labs I've completed on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com). Each folder contains detailed walkthroughs, detection logic, tools used, and key takeaways from different challenges and rooms. This project serves as both a personal learning journal and a showcase of practical cybersecurity skills for Blue Team, SOC Analyst, and detection engineering roles.
