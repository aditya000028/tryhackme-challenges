## üìñ Overview

During SOC monitoring, analyst John observed an alert on an IDS solution indicating potential C2 communication from a user named Browne in the HR department. A suspicious file containing the pattern `THM:{ ________ }` was accessed.

To investigate, a week‚Äôs worth of HTTP connection logs were pulled and ingested into the `connection_logs` index in Kibana.

The objective of this room is to analyze the logs, identify the user‚Äôs activity, and uncover the accessed file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- ELK Stack (Kibana)

## üìù Tasks

### How many events were returned for the month of March 2022?

We first need to set the time filter to look at the month of March in 2022.

After setting it, we see that there are 1482 events

### What is the IP associated with the suspected user in the logs?

By looking at the `source_ip` field in the left field pane, we can see the origin of all the traffic. It looks like the the suspected user Browne's IP is actually `192[.]166[.]65[.]54`

### The user‚Äôs machine used a legit windows binary to download a file from the C2 server. What is the name of the binary?

After setting the source_ip filter to the suspected user's IP, we can see we received 2 hits. Then, I proceeded to add various columns to our results, making it easier to get a better glance at the events that happened.

<img width="1917" height="527" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-11 175035" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/501e8a01-9e35-4b68-924d-7c14c0dbbcf1" />

We can see that the user used `bitsadmin` to download the file from the C2 server. Upon doing some research, it looks like `bitsadmin` is a command-line tool in Windows for managing Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) jobs, which are used to download or upload files, often in the background. This is now a deprecated tool.  

### The infected machine connected with a famous filesharing site in this period, which also acts as a C2 server used by the malware authors to communicate. What is the name of the filesharing site?

Using the above screenshot, we know that the filesharing site is `pastebin[.]com`, with the full URL being `pastebin[.]com/yTg0Ah6a`.

### A file was accessed on the filesharing site. What is the name of the file accessed?

Upon going to the URL, we can see that the file `secret.txt` was accessed with the secret code being `THM{SECRET_CODE}`. Note that since we know simply accessing the `pastebin` URL will not cause any malicious actions, we were able to access the URL without taking any extra precautions such as using VM.

### üìö Lessons Learned

- legitimate tools like BITSAdmin can be abused for malicious purposes
- common services like Pastebin may act as C2 infrastructure
- Monitoring logs in ELK/Kibana helps uncover malicious behaviour quickly
